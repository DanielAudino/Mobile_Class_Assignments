<h1>Canada</h1>

    <p id="overview"> Land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada

      became a self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties to the

      British crown. Economically and technologically the nation has developed

      in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across an unfortified

      border. Canada faces the political challenges of meeting public demands

      for quality improvements in health care and education services, as well as

      responding to the particular concerns of predominantly francophone Quebec.

      Canada also aims to develop its diverse energy resources while maintaining

      its commitment to the environment.</p>
